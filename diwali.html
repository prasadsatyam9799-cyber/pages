    <p>The Festival of Lights that spreads joy and unity</p>
  </header>  <main>
    <p><strong>Diwali</strong>, also known as <strong>Deepavali</strong>, is one of the most important and joyful festivals celebrated in India. It is called the <em>Festival of Lights</em> because people light oil lamps (diyas), candles, and decorate their homes with colorful lights. Diwali usually falls in the months of October or November every year.</p>

    <p>The festival marks the return of <strong>Lord Rama</strong> to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and his victory over the demon king <strong>Ravana</strong>. The people of Ayodhya welcomed Lord Rama by lighting rows of lamps, which is why we continue this tradition today. On this day, people also worship <strong>Goddess Lakshmi</strong>, the goddess of wealth, and <strong>Lord Ganesha</strong>, the remover of obstacles.</p>

    <p>Diwali is celebrated for five days. People clean and decorate their homes, make beautiful rangoli, wear new clothes, exchange sweets, and enjoy fireworks. The night of Diwali is filled with lights, laughter, and togetherness.</p>

    <p>In recent years, many people prefer to celebrate an <strong>eco-friendly Diwali</strong> by avoiding noisy firecrackers and using clay lamps. This helps protect the environment while keeping the joy of the festival alive.</p>

    <p><strong>Diwali teaches us that light always wins over darkness, and good triumphs over evil.</strong> It is a festival that spreads happiness, unity, and hope among everyone.</p>
