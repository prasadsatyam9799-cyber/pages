# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple, framework-less web application for providing weather information. It consists of several HTML pages, a CSS stylesheet, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main landing page.
*   `about.html`: A page describing the project's mission.
*   `contact.html`: A page with contact information and a form.
*   `privacy.html`: The privacy policy page.
*   `terms.html`: The terms of service page.
*   `sports.html`: A page for sports news.
*   `health.html`: A guide to health and fitness.
*   `style.css`: The main stylesheet for the application.
*   `main.js`: The main JavaScript file for general interactivity.
*   `search.js`: JavaScript for the search functionality.
*   `health.js`: JavaScript for the health and fitness page.

## Style and Design

The application uses a simple and clean design. The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. The color scheme is based on a dark gray for the header and buttons, with a white background for the content. The font is Arial, with Material Icons used for iconography.

## Features

*   **Navigation:** A dropdown menu provides navigation to all pages.
*   **Search:** A search bar allows users to search for content within the site.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Current Task: Accessibility and User-Friendliness Improvements

I have made the following changes to improve the accessibility and user-friendliness of the website:

*   **ARIA Labels:** Added `aria-label` attributes to the navigation menu button and the home icon to provide context for screen readers.
*   **Search Bar Label:** Added a `label` for the search input and visually hid it to improve accessibility without altering the visual design.
*   **Dropdown Icon:** Changed the dropdown icon to a more universally recognized "hamburger" icon (&#9776;).
*   **Consistent Improvements:** Applied these changes consistently across all HTML files.
