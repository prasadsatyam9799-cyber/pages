# Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple, framework-less web application for displaying weather information. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages modern web standards for a clean and efficient user experience.

## Project Details

### Structure

*   `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.
*   `style.css`: Contains the styles for the application.
*   `main.js`: Contains the JavaScript for the application.
*   `about.html`: An about page for the application.
*   `contact.html`: A contact page for the application.
*   `privacy.html`: A privacy policy page for the application.
*   `terms.html`: A terms of service page for the application.

### Design

*   **Layout:** The application uses a simple, single-column layout.
*   **Navigation:** A dropdown menu provides access to the different pages of the application.
*   **Styling:** The application uses a clean and modern design with a focus on readability.

### Features

*   **Weather Display:** The application displays weather information for a given location.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is responsive and works on a variety of devices.
*   **Google Analytics:** The application uses Google Analytics to track user engagement.
*   **Google Tag Manager:** The application uses Google Tag Manager to manage marketing tags.

## Current Plan

I have just finished integrating Google Tag Manager into the application. My next step is to create a more robust and feature-rich application. I will start by adding a search bar to the home page that allows users to search for a specific location. I will also add a weather forecast section that displays the weather for the next few days. Finally, I will add a map that displays the current weather conditions for the entire world.
