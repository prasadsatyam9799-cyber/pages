# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple website with a main page and several content pages. The website uses a client-side search functionality to search through its pages.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the website.
- `style.css`: The main stylesheet for the website.
- `main.js`: The main JavaScript file for the website, containing the logic for the dropdown menu and the sticky navbar.
- `search.js`: The JavaScript file for the client-side search functionality.
- `sitemap.xml`: The sitemap for the website.
- `robots.txt`: The robots.txt file for the website.
- `about.html`: The about page.
- `contact.html`: The contact page.
- `privacy.html`: The privacy policy page.
- `terms.html`: The terms of service page.
- `sports.html`: The sports page.
- `health.html`: The health page.

## Features

- **Client-side search:** The website uses a client-side search functionality to search through its pages.
- **Modern UI/UX:** The application has a modern, user-friendly and responsive design.
- **Sticky Navbar:** The navbar stays fixed at the top of the page when the user scrolls.

## Implemented Plan

- Analyzed the project to find and fix any errors or bugs.
- Examined the `index.html` file to understand the basic structure of the application.
- Examined the `main.js` file to understand the JavaScript functionality associated with the main page.
- Examined the `search.js` file and improved the search functionality by using the `sitemap.xml` to get the list of pages to search.
- Created a `sitemap.xml` file that will help search engines to better crawl the application.
- Created a `robots.txt` to improve SEO.
- **User-Friendliness Improvements:**
  - Redesigned the main stylesheet (`style.css`) for a more modern and visually appealing look.
  - Updated the `index.html` to reflect the new design, including a new navigation bar, a hero section and a featured articles section.
  - Updated the `main.js` to work with the new dropdown menu and to add a sticky navbar.
- **Removed the "Team Tap Challenge" game:**
    - Deleted `tap-game.html`, `tap-game.css`, `src/tap-game.js` and all related web components.
    - Updated `index.html` to remove links to the game.
    - Updated `sitemap.xml` to remove the game's entry.
- **Improved Search UX:**
    - Added a "Loading..." message to the search results while the search is in progress.
    - Added a "No results found." message if the search does not find any matching pages.


## Current Plan

- The project is in a good state. I will wait for further instructions.
