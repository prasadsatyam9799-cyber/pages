# Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a simple, framework-less web application for displaying weather information. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages modern web standards for a clean and efficient user experience.

## Project Details

### Structure

*   `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.
*   `style.css`: Contains the styles for the application.
*   `main.js`: Contains the JavaScript for the application.
*   `about.html`: An about page for the application.
*   `contact.html`: A contact page for the application.
*   `privacy.html`: A privacy policy page for the application.
*   `terms.html`: A terms of service page for the application.
*   `health.html`: A health and fitness guide.

### Design

*   **Layout:** The application uses a simple, single-column layout.
*   **Navigation:** A dropdown menu provides access to the different pages of the application.
*   **Styling:** The application uses a clean and modern design with a focus on readability.

### Features

*   **Weather Display:** The application displays weather information for a given location.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is responsive and works on a variety of devices.
*   **Google Analytics:** The application uses Google Analytics to track user engagement.
*   **Google Tag Manager:** The application uses Google Tag Manager to manage marketing tags.

## Current Plan

I will improve the `health.html` page by:

1.  **Improving the visuals:** I will create a new CSS file, `health.css`, and link it to `health.html`. I will then add a more modern design, including a better color palette, custom fonts, and a "Back to Top" button.
2.  **Adding interactivity:** I will make the sections collapsible and add smooth scrolling.
3.  **Refactoring the sections into a reusable Web Component:** I will create a new JavaScript file, `health.js`, and define a new custom element, `<health-section>`. This will make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
4.  **Adding a navigation link to `health.html` from `index.html`:** I will add a link to the new page in the main navigation menu.
