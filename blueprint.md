# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a responsive website for "Weathering Online," a source for weather information, news, and interactive content. The site features a clean, modern design with a focus on user experience and accessibility.

## Implemented Styles, Designs, and Features

*   **Responsive Layout:** The website is fully responsive, adapting to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Modern CSS:** The project utilizes modern CSS practices, including a mobile-first approach, CSS variables for theming, and a clean, organized stylesheet.
*   **Featured Articles:** The homepage highlights three featured articles with relevant imagery and links to their respective pages:
    *   Understanding Weather Patterns
    *   The Science of Climate Change
    *   Extreme Weather Events
*   **Navigation:** A responsive navigation bar with a dropdown menu provides easy access to all pages.
*   **Footer:** A comprehensive footer includes quick links, legal information, and social media icons.

## Current Task: Refine Content and Navigation

The goal is to replace the generic placeholder articles with content more relevant to the "Weathering Online" theme and create the corresponding pages.

### Plan:

1.  **Update Featured Articles:**
    *   Replaced the existing "Sports," "Health," and "About Us" articles with "Understanding Weather Patterns," "The Science of Climate Change," and "Extreme Weather Events."
2.  **Create New HTML Pages:**
    *   Created `weather-patterns.html`, `climate-change.html`, and `extreme-weather.html` with placeholder content.
3.  **Update Navigation:**
    *   Removed the "Free Fire Challenge" link and added links to the new article pages in the main navigation and footer.
