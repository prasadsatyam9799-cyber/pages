# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the design, features, and implementation plan for this web application. It serves as a single source of truth for the project's development.

## Current State

The project is a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application. The initial file structure includes:
- `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.
- `style.css`: For styling the application.
- `main.js`: For application logic.

## Plan for Current Request: "Left upper make a menu bar of 3 dots line, and like a Blog page"

### 1. Objective
Create a responsive navigation menu for a blog-style website. The menu will be toggled by a "three dots line" icon in the upper-left corner of the page.

### 2. Implementation Steps

#### a. HTML (`index.html`)
- A `<blog-menu>` custom element will be added to the `<body>` of the page. This component will encapsulate the entire menu functionality.

#### b. JavaScript (`main.js`) - Web Component
- A new Web Component named `BlogMenu` will be created.
- **Shadow DOM:** The component will use Shadow DOM to encapsulate its structure and styling, preventing conflicts with global styles.
- **Structure:**
    - A `<button>` element will serve as the "three dots line" menu toggle. The icon will be created using CSS.
    - A `<nav>` element will contain the menu links.
    - The navigation will include placeholder links for a typical blog: "Home", "About", "Posts", and "Contact".
- **Functionality:**
    - An event listener on the menu toggle button will add/remove a class to the `<nav>` element to control its visibility.

#### c. CSS (`style.css`)
- Basic global styles will be added to ensure the menu is well-integrated into the page layout. The component itself will be styled within its Shadow DOM.

#### d. Design and Aesthetics
- **Icon:** The menu icon will be styled to be easily recognizable and interactive.
- **Menu Panel:** The navigation panel will slide in from the left. It will have a clean, modern design with a clear hierarchy for the navigation links.
- **Responsiveness:** The menu will be designed to work on both mobile and desktop screens.
