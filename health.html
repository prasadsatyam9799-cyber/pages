    <health-section title="1. Introduction: Why Health & Fitness Matter">
      <p>Health and fitness are the foundation of a happy and energetic life. A healthy lifestyle helps improve physical strength, mental clarity, and emotional stability. People who maintain fitness tend to live longer, stay more active, and enjoy better immunity against diseases.</p>
      <p class="summary">Summary: Good health is the key to energy, strength, and a long life.</p>
    </health-section>

    <health-section title="2. Nutrition & Diet">
      <p>Food is fuel for the body. A balanced diet should include proteins (for muscles), carbohydrates (for energy), healthy fats (for brain and heart health), vitamins, and minerals. Eating fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins keeps the body fit. Avoiding junk food, excess sugar, and oily meals is equally important. Drinking 7–8 glasses of water daily also keeps digestion and metabolism strong.</p>
      <p class="summary">Summary: Eat a balanced diet, avoid junk food, and drink enough water to stay healthy.</p>
    </health-section>

    <health-section title="3. Exercise & Workouts">
        <p>Exercise keeps the body active and prevents lifestyle diseases. Cardio exercises like running, cycling, or swimming strengthen the heart. Strength training builds muscle and burns fat. Yoga improves flexibility and reduces stress. Beginners should start slow and gradually increase intensity. Exercising at least 30 minutes a day is enough to see long-term benefits.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Regular exercise improves strength, stamina, and flexibility.</p>
    </health-section>

    <health-section title="4. Mental Health & Wellness">
        <p>Physical fitness is incomplete without mental wellness. Stress, anxiety, and lack of sleep can weaken the immune system. Meditation, deep breathing, and mindfulness are excellent ways to reduce stress. Sleeping 7–8 hours daily helps the brain recover and improves focus. A calm and balanced mind improves productivity and emotional stability.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: A healthy mind supports a healthy body—manage stress and sleep well.</p>
    </health-section>

    <health-section title="5. Healthy Lifestyle Habits">
        <p>Small daily habits create long-term fitness. Staying hydrated, sleeping at fixed times, eating home-cooked meals, and avoiding smoking or alcohol improves overall health. Consistency is more important than perfection. Building discipline in everyday life ensures steady health progress.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Consistent healthy habits shape long-term fitness success.</p>
    </health-section>

    <health-section title="6. Weight Management">
        <p>Maintaining a healthy weight prevents diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart problems. Instead of crash diets, focus on portion control, regular exercise, and sustainable habits. BMI (Body Mass Index) and body fat percentage help track health, but overall lifestyle is more important than just numbers.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Manage weight with balanced diet, exercise, and sustainable habits.</p>
    </health-section>

    <health-section title="7. Injury Prevention & Safety">
        <p>Exercising without proper form can cause injury. Always start with warm-up stretches and end with cool-down exercises. Use correct posture, avoid lifting weights beyond your capacity, and take rest days for recovery. Safety ensures long-term progress without setbacks.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Warm-up, correct form, and rest prevent injuries.</p>
    </health-section>

    <health-section title="8. Tracking Progress">
        <p>Tracking helps measure improvements. Use fitness apps, journals, or wearable devices to monitor steps, workouts, sleep, and calories. Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to stay motivated. Progress tracking prevents loss of focus and helps celebrate achievements.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Track progress and set SMART goals for motivation.</p>
    </health-section>

    <health-section title="9. Motivation & Inspiration">
        <p>Staying motivated is the hardest part of fitness. Reading success stories, joining fitness communities, or setting personal challenges can help. Even small achievements like walking 5,000 steps daily or losing 1 kg are worth celebrating. Remember: progress takes time, but consistency always pays off.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Motivation and consistency turn small efforts into big results.</p>
    </health-section>

    <health-section title="10. Age-Related Health & Fitness">
        <h3>a) Children & Teenagers (5–18 years)</h3>
        <p>Young bodies need at least 60 minutes of daily activity. Outdoor sports, running, cycling, or dancing keep them active and improve bone and muscle growth. Avoiding junk food and eating calcium-rich foods supports healthy development. Screen time should be limited to prevent obesity.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Kids need daily activity, healthy food, and limited screen time.</p>

        <h3>b) Young Adults (18–30 years)</h3>
        <p>This age group has strong metabolism, making it the best time to build strength and stamina. A mix of cardio and weight training works best. Balanced nutrition supports muscle growth and energy. Stress management is important due to studies or work pressure.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Build strength, stamina, and healthy habits during young adulthood.</p>

        <h3>c) Adults (30–45 years)</h3>
        <p>Metabolism begins to slow down, so weight management becomes important. Regular exercise and strength training prevent early muscle loss.

        <p class="summary">Summary: Stay active, manage weight, and balance work-life stress.</p>

        <h3>d) Middle Age (45–60 years)</h3>
        <p>Joint care and heart health are priorities. Walking, swimming, or yoga are safe choices. A diet low in saturated fats helps control cholesterol. Light weight training keeps bones strong. Regular health screenings become essential at this age.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Focus on heart, joints, and regular health checkups.</p>

        <h3>e) Seniors (60+ years)</h3>
        <p>Gentle activities like walking, stretching, and chair yoga improve mobility and prevent falls. Calcium and Vitamin D keep bones healthy. Staying socially active reduces loneliness and depression. Gentle strength training helps maintain independence in daily life.</p>
        <p class="summary">Summary: Gentle exercise, social activity, and nutrition support healthy aging.</p>
