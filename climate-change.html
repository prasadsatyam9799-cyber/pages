                <h2>The Science of Climate Change</h2>
                <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. While some of these shifts are natural, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.</p>

                <h3>The Greenhouse Effect</h3>
                <p>The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth’s surface. When the Sun’s energy reaches the Earth’s atmosphere, some of it is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases. This process is essential for life on Earth as it keeps our planet warm enough to sustain us. However, an excess of greenhouse gases can cause the Earth's temperature to rise.</p>

                <h3>Human Impact</h3>
                <p>Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels for electricity and transportation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Deforestation also plays a crucial role, as trees absorb carbon dioxide, a primary greenhouse gas. When forests are cleared, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere.</p>

                <h3>Consequences of Climate Change</h3>
                <p>The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include more frequent and intense heatwaves, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture. Urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more sustainable future.</p>
